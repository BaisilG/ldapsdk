INFO_LDIF_DIFF_TOOL_DESCRIPTION_1=Compare the contents of two files \
  containing LDIF entries.  The output will be an LDIF file containing the \
  add, delete, and modify change records needed to convert the data in the \
  source LDIF file into the data in the target LDIF file.
INFO_LDIF_DIFF_TOOL_DESCRIPTION_2=This tool works best with small LDIF files \
  because it reads the entire contents of the source and target LDIF files \
  into memory so they can be quickly compared.  If you encounter an out of \
  memory error while running the tool, you may need to increase the amount of \
  memory available to the JVM used to invoke it.
INFO_LDIF_DIFF_TOOL_DESCRIPTION_3=The amount of memory available to the JVM \
  may be customized by invoking the JVM with the '-Xms' and '-Xmx' arguments \
  (which specify the initial and maximum amounts of memory that it may use, \
  respectively).  These arguments should be immediately followed (without any \
  intervening space) by an integer and a unit to specify the amount of \
  memory that may be used.  The unit may be either 'm' to indicate that the \
  size is in megabytes, or 'g' to indicate that it is in gigabytes.  For \
  example, '-Xms512m' indicates that the JVM should be given an initial heap \
  size of 512 megabytes, while '-Xmx2g' indicates that it should be given a \
  maximum heap size of two gigabytes.
INFO_LDIF_DIFF_TOOL_DESCRIPTION_4_STANDALONE=When invoking the {0} tool \
  with the shell script or batch file included as part of the LDAP SDK, you \
  may use the 'JAVA_ARGS' environment variable to specify the arguments to \
  use when invoking the JVM.
INFO_LDIF_DIFF_TOOL_DESCRIPTION_4_PING_SERVER=When invoking the {0} tool \
  included in the installation of a Ping Identity server product, you may \
  edit the config/java.properties file to specify the arguments to use when \
  invoking the JVM.  After modifying the file, run the dsjavaproperties tool \
  to ensure that those changes will be used for subsequent tool invocations.
INFO_LDIF_DIFF_ARG_GROUP_SOURCE=Source LDIF Arguments
INFO_LDIF_DIFF_ARG_DESC_SOURCE_LDIF=The path to to the LDIF file containing \
  the entries to use as the source data set.  This argument must be \
  specified, and the source LDIF file must exist.  The LDIF file may \
  optionally be gzip-compressed and/or passphrase-encrypted.
INFO_LDIF_DIFF_ARG_DESC_SOURCE_PW_FILE_STANDALONE=The path to to file \
  containing the passphrase used to encrypt the contents of the source LDIF \
  file.  If this argument is provided, the file must exist and must contain \
  exactly one line that contains only the encryption passphrase.  If the \
  source LDIF file is encrypted but this argument is not provided, then the \
  tool will interactively prompt for the passphrase.
INFO_LDIF_DIFF_ARG_DESC_SOURCE_PW_FILE_PING_SERVER=The path to to file \
  containing the passphrase used to encrypt the contents of the source LDIF \
  file.  If this argument is provided, the file must exist and must contain \
  exactly one line that contains only the encryption passphrase.  If the \
  source LDIF file is encrypted but this argument is not provided, and if the \
  file was not encrypted with a key from the server's encryption settings \
  database, then the tool will interactively prompt for the passphrase.
INFO_LDIF_DIFF_ARG_GROUP_TARGET=Target LDIF Arguments
INFO_LDIF_DIFF_ARG_DESC_TARGET_LDIF=The path to to the LDIF file containing \
  the entries to use as the target data set.  This argument must be \
  specified, and the target LDIF file must exist.  The LDIF file may \
  optionally be gzip-compressed and/or passphrase-encrypted.
INFO_LDIF_DIFF_ARG_DESC_TARGET_PW_FILE_STANDALONE=The path to to file \
  containing the passphrase used to encrypt the contents of the target LDIF \
  file.  If this argument is provided, the file must exist and must contain \
  exactly one line that contains only the encryption passphrase.  If the \
  target LDIF file is encrypted but this argument is not provided, then the \
  tool will interactively prompt for the passphrase.
INFO_LDIF_DIFF_ARG_DESC_TARGET_PW_FILE_PING_SERVER=The path to to file \
  containing the passphrase used to encrypt the contents of the target LDIF \
  file.  If this argument is provided, the file must exist and must contain \
  exactly one line that contains only the encryption passphrase.  If the \
  target LDIF file is encrypted but this argument is not provided, and if the \
  file was not encrypted with a key from the server's encryption settings \
  database, then the tool will interactively prompt for the passphrase.
INFO_LDIF_DIFF_ARG_GROUP_OUTUPT=Output LDIF Arguments
INFO_LDIF_DIFF_ARG_DESC_OUTPUT_LDIF=The path to to the LDIF file to which the \
  resulting LDIF add, delete, and modify change records will be written.  If \
  this file already exists, then the new LDIF records will be appended to it \
  unless the '--overwriteExisting' argument is provided.  If this file does \
  not exist, then the parent directory must exist.  If this argument is not \
  provided, then the changes will be written to standard output.
INFO_LDIF_DIFF_ARG_DESC_COMPRESS_OUTPUT=GZIP-compress the data as it is \
  written to the output file.
INFO_LDIF_DIFF_ARG_DESC_ENCRYPT_OUTPUT=Encrypt the data as it is written to \
  the output file.  If the '--outputEncryptionPassphraseFile' argument is \
  provided, then the passphrase contained in that file will be used to \
  encrypt the output.  Otherwise, the tool will interactively prompt for the \
  passphrase.
INFO_LDIF_DIFF_ARG_DESC_OUTPUT_PW_FILE=The path to a file containing the \
  passphrase to use to encrypt the contents of the output file.  If this \
  argument is provided, then the file must exist, and it must contain exactly \
  one line comprised entirely of the encryption passphrase.
INFO_LDIF_DIFF_ARG_DESC_OVERWRITE_EXISTING=Overwrite the output file if it \
  already exists, rather than appending to it.  This argument must be \
  provided if the output file already exists and either of the \
  '--compressOutput' or '--encryptOutput' arguments is provided.
INFO_LDIF_DIFF_ARG_GROUP_CONTENT=Content Arguments
INFO_LDIF_DIFF_ARG_DESC_INCLUDE_OPERATIONAL=Include operational attributes in \
  the output file, in both add and modify change records.  By default, only \
  user attributes will be included.
INFO_LDIF_DIFF_ARG_DESC_EXCLUDE_NO_USER_MOD=Exclude operational attributes \
  declared with the NO-USER-MODIFICATION constraint.  This argument is only \
  applicable if the '--includeOperationalAttributes' argument is provided.
INFO_LDIF_DIFF_ARG_DESC_NON_REVERSIBLE_MODS=Generate modify change records in \
  non-reversible form, in which attribute differences are written with the \
  'replace' modification type.  By default, modifications will be generated \
  in reversible form, with delete modifications to remove existing values \
  that are no longer included and add modifications to insert new values.  \
  Using reversible form is generally considered safer, as attempts to apply \
  the modifications are more likely to fail if the entry has been updated.  \
  Modifications generated in non-reversible form are more likely to succeed \
  when applied, but at a greater risk of losing changes that have been \
  processed since the LDIF files were generated.
INFO_LDIF_DIFF_ARG_DESC_SINGLE_VALUE_CHANGES=Generate a separate modify \
  change record for each attribute value that is to be removed from or added \
  to the target entry.  By default, all modifications to an entry will be \
  provided in a single modify change record.  If a separate modify change \
  record is generated for each attribute value, it may be easier to apply \
  changes if the data set has changed since the LDIF files were generated \
  (by instructing the tool that is applying changes to ignore failures).
INFO_LDIF_DIFF_ARG_DESC_STRIP_TRAILING_SPACES=Strip off any illegal trailing \
  spaces identified in LDIF entries rather than rejecting those entries.
INFO_LDIF_DIFF_ARG_DESC_SCHEMA_PATH_STANDALONE=The path to an LDIF file (or \
  a directory containing multiple LDIF files) with the schema definitions to \
  use during processing.  This argument may be used multiple times to specify \
  multiple schema paths.  If this argument is ot provided, the LDAP SDK's \
  default standard schema will be used.
INFO_LDIF_DIFF_ARG_DESC_SCHEMA_PATH_PING_SERVER=The path to an LDIF file (or \
  a directory containing multiple LDIF files) with the schema definitions to \
  use during processing.  This argument may be used multiple times to specify \
  multiple schema paths.  If this argument is ot provided, the server's \
  schema will be used.
ERR_LDIF_DIFF_APPEND_WITH_COMPRESSION_OR_ENCRYPTION=If the output LDIF file \
  already exists, and if either the {0} or {1} argument is provided, then the \
  {2} argument must also be provided.
ERR_LDIF_DIFF_CANNOT_GET_SCHEMA=An error occurred while attempting to obtain \
  the schema to use during processing:  {0}
ERR_LDIF_DIFF_CANNOT_READ_SOURCE_LDIF=An error occurred while attempting to \

  reading:  {0}
INFO_LDIF_DIFF_PROMPT_FOR_ENC_PW=Enter the passphrase used to encrypt ''{0}'':
ERR_LDIF_DIFF_PROMPT_WRONG_ENC_PW=The provided passphrase was not correct.
ERR_LDIF_DIFF_CANNOT_DECRYPT_LDIF_FILE=Unable to decrypt the LDIF file:  {0}
ERR_LDIF_DIFF_CANNOT_DECOMPRESS_LDIF_FILE=Unable to decompress the LDIF \
  file:  {0}

  encrypt the output LDIF file:
INFO_LDIF_DIFF_CONFIRM_OUTPUT_FILE_ENC_PW=Confirm the encryption passphrase:
ERR_LDIF_DIFF_CANNOT_ENRYPT_OUTPUT_FILE=Cannot encrypt the output file:  {0}
ERR_LDIF_WRITER_CANNOT_WRITE_MODS_TO_ENTRY=An error occurred while \
  attempting to write modifications to entry ''{0}'':  {1}
ERR_LDIF_WRITER_CANNOT_WRITE_DELETE_FOR_ENTRY=An error occurred while \
  attempting to write a delete change record for entry ''{0}'':  {1}
ERR_LDIF_WRITER_CANNOT_WRITE_ADD_FOR_ENTRY=An error occurred while attempting \
  to write an add change record for entry ''{0}'':  {1}
INFO_LDIF_DIFF_EXAMPLE_1=Identify the changes needed to transform the set of \
  entries contained in the 'actual.ldif' file into the set of entries \
  contained in the 'desired.ldif' file.  Operational attributes will be \
  ignored, and modifications will be presented in reversible form.
INFO_LDIF_DIFF_EXAMPLE_2=Identify the changes needed to transform the set of \
  entries contained in the 'actual.ldif' file into the set of entries \
  contained in the 'desired.ldif' file.  Operational attributes not \
  declared with the NO-USER-MODIFICATION will be included, and modifications \
  will be presented in non-reversible form.
